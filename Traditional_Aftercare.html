                <p>
                    You will need a liquid, unscented soap to clean your tattoo (preferably one that is antibacterial, such as Spectro Jel or 
                    <br> Pursan.) We usually sell Pursan soap at the studio for $10 + HST.  You will also need to buy a water based unscented 
                    <br> lotion for later in the healing process, I personally recommend Unscented Lubriderm lotion, or Unscented Vaseline 
                    <br> lotion (not petroleum Jelly)
                </p>
                <p>1. Wash your hands with liquid antimicrobial soap.</p>
                <p>2. Remove the wrapping of your tattoo. Do not rewrap or leave the wrap on for longer than 2-4 hours.</p>
                <p>
                    3. Wash the tattoo thoroughly with soap and water. I usually recommend doing so in the shower. Ensure you get all 
                    <br> the plasma, blood etc off of your tattoo, but do not scrub hard.
                </p>
                <p>
                    4. Pat dry with a clean dry paper towel. Do not use a bath towel as they harbour bacteria and are rough against the 
                    <br> skin.
                </p>
                <p>Do not rewrap your tattoo after this. Leave it to air out, and wear loose/breathable clothing.  </p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>
                    -Follow the routine above twice a day for the first 2 days after your tattoo. If you go to the gym be sure to give the 
                    <br> tattoo a good wash afterwards.
                </p>
                <p>
                    -After the first 2-3 days, start applying a thin layer of the lotion once or twice a day. Moisturize after washing, or as 
                    <br> needed (max 4 times per day)
                </p>
                <p>-Always wash your hands before touching your fresh tattoo until it's healed (usually 15-30 days)</p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>-Do not pick or scratch at your tattoo while it is healing as this can cause permanent damage to your new piece.</p>
                <p>
                    -Keep it clean and dry as much as possible- Do not soak the tattoo (i.e. baths, saunas, pools, etc) for the next 3 
                    <br> weeks.
                </p>
                <p>-Keep the tattoo out of direct sunlight</p>
                <p>-Keep pets and pet hair away from your tattoo until it is fully healed.</p>
                <p>-Once your tattoo is fully healed, be sure to apply sunscreen! Excessive sun exposure can lead to fading.</p>
