                        You will need a liquid, unscented soap to clean your tattoo (preferably one that is antibacterial, such as Spectro Jel or 
                        <br> Pursan.) We usually sell Pursan soap at the studio for $10 + HST.  You will also need to buy a water based unscented 
                        <br> lotion for later in the healing process, I personally recommend Unscented Lubriderm lotion, or Unscented Vaseline 
                        <br> lotion (not petroleum Jelly)

                        <br>
                        <br>

                        1. Wash your hands with liquid antimicrobial soap.

                        <br>
                        <br>
                    
                        2. Remove the wrapping of your tattoo. Do not rewrap or leave the wrap on for longer than 2-4 hours. 

                        <br>
                        <br>
                    
                        3. Wash the tattoo thoroughly with soap and water. I usually recommend doing so in the shower. Ensure you get all 
                        <br> the plasma, blood etc off of your tattoo, but do not scrub hard.

                        <br>
                        <br>
                    
                        4. Pat dry with a clean dry paper towel. Do not use a bath towel as they harbour bacteria and are rough against the skin.

                        <br>
                        <br>
                    
                        Do not rewrap your tattoo after this. Leave it to air out, and wear loose/breathable clothing.
