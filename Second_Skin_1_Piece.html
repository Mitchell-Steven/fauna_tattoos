        <h1>Second-skin aftercare for small/black and grey tattoos</h1>
        <br>
        <p>
            I have used a Second-skin bandage for your tattoo. It is often referred to as Saniderm, Hypafix, and Tegaderm. 
            <br> The specific brand I use is Hypafix, but the aftercare/application is the same across brands.
        </p>
        <p>Leave the bandage on for 5-6 days total if possible.</p>
        <p>
            If you are noticing any excessive redness around the bandage or excessive fluid build-up underneath, please remove 
            <br> it and follow <a href="Traditional_Aftercare.html">these aftercare instructions instead</a>. Some fluid buildup is totally normal, but if you're noticing any 
            <br> pooling or puddling I would recommend taking it off.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once you have taken off the bandage (whether you kept it on for the full 6 days or not), be sure to give your tattoo a 
            <br> good wash with water and liquid unscented soap. (I suggest Spectro Jel, or Pursan) 
        </p>
        <p>Once washed, pat dry with a clean paper towel and do not re-wrap.</p>
        <p>Generally your tattoo will be fully healed in about 10-12 days total.</p>
        <p>
            You might experience a very light peeling of the skin at this time, apply your moisturizer 2-3 times a day until it's 
            <br> totally healed.
