        <h1>FAQ</h1>
        <br>
        <p>Q: Covid-19 Protocols?</p>
        <p>
            A: Hand washing/sanitizing are required immediately upon entry to the studio, and masks are optional at this time. 
            <br> If you are feeling unwell leading up to your appointment, please let me know and I will be happy to reschedule you. 
            <br> There is no penalty for late cancellations in the event that you are experiencing any symptoms. If you have come in 
            <br> contact with someone who has tested positive for Covid-19, please wear a mask at your appointment. Please do not 
            <br> bring any guests with you to your appointment, as we are limiting the number of people in the studio as much as 
            <br> possible. 
        </p>
        <hr width="20%">
        <br>
        <p>Q: How can I book an appointment with you?</p>
        <p>
            A: Please submit a <a href="./Consultation_Form.html">consultation form</a> if you would like to inquire about a pre-drawn flash design or a custom tattoo 
            <br> idea, and I will get back to you usually within a week or less. If you are inquiring while my books are closed I will 
            <br> likely still respond, it just might take me a bit longer to get back to you! Required information for any appointment 
            <br> or consultation booking is as follows:
        </p>
        <b>Subject matter, size in inches, placement, colour or black and grey, and reference images.</b>
        <hr width="20%">
        <br>
        <p>Q: How can I book a consultation with you?</p>
        <p>
            A: I do all consultations via email after receiving your consult form. If either of us feels that further discussion is 
            <br> required then we can go ahead and book you in for an in-person consultation at my studio. I do not offer phone 
            <br> consultations or Zoom consultations.
        </p>
        <hr width="20%">
        <br>
        <p>Q: What is your rate/pricing?</p>
        <p>
            A: I have a minimum charge of $100, and otherwise pricing is dependent on the piece. Once I have received your 
            <br> consult form I will get back to you with a price quote.
        </p>
        <p>For multi-session pieces/full day sessions, I typically charge a flat rate of $800 + tax per day.</p>
        <hr width="20%">
        <br>
        <p>Q: Deposit policy?</p>
        <p>
            A: I require a non-refundable deposit to book an appointment. Deposits currently range from $50-$150 depending 
            <br> on the complexity of your design and number of sessions required. Your deposit covers the cost of <b>one reschedule</b>, 
            <br> and goes towards the overall cost of your tattoo.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you need to reschedule for any reason please let me know a minimum of 72 hours in advance, otherwise the 
            <br> deposit may be forfeited and a new deposit of equal or greater value will be required to book back in.
        </p>
        <hr width="20%">
        <br>
        <p>Q: Where are you located?</p>
        <p>
            A: I currently work out of a private studio near College and Bathurst in Toronto, Ontario. Due to the fact that I do 
            <br> not accept walk-ins, the address will only be provided once you are booked in. 
        </p>
        <hr width="20%">
        <br>
        <p>Q: Do you tattoo people of all skin tones?</p>
        <p>
            A: Yes! Some examples can be found in my <a href="./Tattoos.html">portfolio</a> (which I am always updating) as well as on my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/fauna_tattoos">instagram</a> 
            <br> page. If you're interested in one of my flash designs, but are worried the colours wont work well for you, I am always 
            <br> happy to adjust colour palettes/discuss options.
        </p>
        <hr width="20%">
        <br>
        <p>Q: Can I use numbing cream during my tattoo appointment?</p>
        <p>
            A: Yes! I have no issue if you would like to use a topical numbing cream for your tattoo. HOWEVER you are 
            <br> responsible for applying it an adequate amount of time prior to your session - typically they need to sit on your skin, 
            <br> wrapped in saran wrap for 45 minutes to 1 hour. If you would like further instructions on how to achieve best results 
            <br> with numbing cream, please email me and I will give you an in-depth run down. The cream WILL NOT WORK if it 
            <br> is used improperly.
        </p>
        <p>
            I personally recommend Zensa - which can be purchased over the counter at the pharmacy, or online/Amazon. 
            <br> I have also had some clients recommend Dr.Numb, which can be purchased online as well. 
        </p>
        <hr width="20%">
        <br>
        <p>Q: Is there anything I need to do before my appointment/ in preparation for my session?</p>
        <p>
            A: Please be sure to eat a good meal prior to your appointment - this will ensure your body has enough fuel to get 
            <br> you through your tattoo as comfortably as possible. It also never hurts to bring snacks/water if you are booked for a 
            <br> longer appointment.
        </p>
        <p>
            I also recommend wearing comfortable clothing, and something that can easily expose the area we will be tattooing. 
            <br> Please do not wear something you would be devastated to get ink on.
        </p>
        <hr width="20%">
        <br>
        <p>Q: Are there any tattoos you do not feel comfortable doing/are unable to do?</p>
        <p>
            A: If I do not feel that I am the right artist for your piece - whether it is due to placement, style, or subject - I will let 
            <br> you know. In general though, I DO NOT do anything geometric/ornamental, nor will I take on tattoos in the 
            <br> following placements: Fingers, behind the ear/neck, or face. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I do not specialize in cover-ups or fix-ups, however I am open to discussing your ideas and if it is something I feel 
            <br> confident in taking on, I will let you know.
        </p>

        <br>
        <p>Q: How do I take care of my tattoo / I lost the aftercare instruction sheet you gave me:</p>
        <a href="./Aftercare.html"><p>A: Please click here to be directed to my aftercare page! </p></a>
