        <h1>Second-skin, and changing your bandage.</h1>
        <br>
        <p>Leave the first bandage on for 24 hours.</p>
        <p>
            After 24 hours remove the first bandage, and give your tattoo a good wash with water and liquid unscented soap (I 
            <br> recommend Spectro Jel or Pursan). I also highly recommend doing this in the shower and gently running water over 
            <br> your tattoo/the bandage to help peel it off.   
        </p>
        <p>
            It helps to remove the bandage as the last step in your shower routine, in order to avoid getting any scented 
            <br> soaps/shampoo etc on the tattoo.
        </p>
        <p>Pat the tattoo dry with a paper towel. Allow to air dry for a minute or two.</p>
        <p>
            Once the tattoo is fully dry, apply the second bandage I gave you. Try to avoid large air bubbles if possible, small 
            <br> ones are okay, but it's best to pop any large ones and patch the hole with extra bandage.
        </p>
        <p>Leave the second piece(s) on for about 5 days.</p>
        <p>
            *If there is fluid build-up accumulating under the second bandage, please remove it and follow the <a href="Traditional_Aftercare.html">traditional 
            <br> aftercare method.</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            If the second-skin bandage is bothering you at all, or you're noticing excessive redness around the bandage, please 
            <br> take it off and follow the more <a href="Traditional_Aftercare.html">traditional aftercare method.</a>
